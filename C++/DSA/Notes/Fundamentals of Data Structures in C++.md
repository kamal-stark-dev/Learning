# Fundamentals of Data Structures in C++

> Below are the notes from the book [Fundamentals of Data Structures in C++](https://www.amazon.in/Fundamentals-Data-Structures-Sahni-Horowitz/dp/8173716064).

### Process of solving a problem -

1. **Requirements** - What's the input what is the expected output etc.
2. **Analysis** - How you are going to approach the problem (bottom-up or top-down etc.)
3. **Design** - Creation of abstract data types, specifying algorithms and strategies.
4. **Coding** - In this step we write the code for the abstract data types, and the algorithms selected in the design phase.
5. **Verification & Testing** - Verify that you approach is working as expected and the program is not prone to any fatal errors.

### Object Oriented Design -

**Object** - An object is an entity that performs computations and has a local state.

A language is said to be _object-oriented_ if:

1. it supports objects
2. it requires objects to belong to a class
3. it supports inheritance

A language which supports objects and requires them belonging to a class but does't supports inheritance is a object-based language.

> `C++` is object-oriented whereas `JavaScript` is object-based language.

### Evolution of Programming Languages -

1. First Generation Languages: `FORTRAN`, used for evaluating mathematical expressions.
2. Second Generation Languages: `Pascal` & `C`, emphasis was on effectively expressing algorithms.
3. Third Generation Languages: `Modula`, introduced the concept of abstract data types.
4. Fourth Generation Languages (Object-Oriented Languages): `Smalltalk`, `Objective C`, `C++`, emphasis on relationship between abstract data types through the use of inheritance.

> `C++` was designed by `Bjarne Stourstrup` of **AT&BT Bell Laboratories** in the early 1980s. It was designed to incorporate the object-oriented paradigm to the C programming language.

C was widely-used in the industry because it was:

1. **Efficient**: It has a number of low-level features which utilizes the hardware better than other languages.
2. **Felxible**: Can be used to solve problems in most application areas.
3. **Available**: Compilers for C are readily available for most computers.

> Other influences for C++ were `Simula67` and `Algol68`.
