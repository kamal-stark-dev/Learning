COMPILER:
> The job of a compiler is to convert the source code into machine code that the computer can
understand. It takes the high-level code written in C++ and translates it into low-level machine
code which is either a constant data or instructions.

It creates the `.exe` file and `.obj` object files.

LINKER:
> The job of a linker is to combine multiple object (`.obj`) files into a single executable file.
It resolves references between different object files, ensuring that all functions and variables are
correctly linked together.
