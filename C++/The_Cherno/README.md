# C++ - by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb)

**But WHY C++?**

- The biggest reason for using it is because of direct control over the hardware.
- You just need the suiting compiler for a machine and the code will work for that machine. (Windows, Linux, MAC, Mobile Applications and all other stuff like Nitendo machines etc.)

> Note: If you write bad C++ code then it'll definitely be slower than C# or Java.

## How C++ Works?

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
