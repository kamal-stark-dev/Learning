## Project Ideas

Here are some project ideas using `pyautogui` and unleash the _Automation Beast_ inside you.

1. **Automated Data Entry Bot** - Reads from Excel and fill out forms.

2. **Auto Clicker for Websites** - Automate clicks for games or repetative tasks.

3. **Prank Script** - Move the mouse every 5 seconds to annoy someone.

4. **Screenshot Logger** - Takes screenshot every minute for security purposes.

5. **AI-Assited GUI Navigation** - Use OCR ([Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)) to read on-screen text andd make intelligent decisions.
