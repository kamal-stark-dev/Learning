# Assigning values to variables (store values)

"""
Variables: Container for storing any kind of data, once created it's value can be reused

Syntax: `var_name = value`

Naming Conventions:
    - name should not start with a number.
    - name can contain only letters, numbers and underscore symbol.
    - name should be descriptive and use lowercase letters.
    - words should be separated by underscores (snake_case).
    - avoid using reserved keywords and special characters.
