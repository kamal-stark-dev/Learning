# NumPy Library

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

## Key Features

- **N-dimensional array object (`ndarray`)**
- **Broadcasting functions**
- **Mathematical, logical, and statistical operations**
- **Linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities**
- **Integration with C/C++ and Fortran code**

## Use Cases

- **Data Analysis:** Efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data.
- **Machine Learning:** Basis for libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
- **Image Processing:** Handling image data as arrays.
- **Scientific Simulations:** Fast computations for physics, chemistry, and engineering problems.
- **Financial Analysis:** Time series and statistical analysis.

## Installation

You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Or, if you are using Anaconda:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(arr.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)

# Perform element-wise addition
result = arr + 10
print(result)
```
